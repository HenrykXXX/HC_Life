# HCL (HC Life) - FiveM Life/RP Mod

Welcome to the HCL (HC Life) repository! This mod is designed to recreate the immersive life servers from Arma 3 in FiveM. It's currently in the early development phase, but we're working hard to bring new features and improvements constantly.

## Introduction

The HCL (HC Life) mod aims to provide a rich and immersive role-playing experience on FiveM, inspired by the life servers from Arma 3. Our goal is to create a dynamic world where players can engage in various activities and experience realistic interactions. While the project is in its early development phase, we are committed to adding new features and refining the gameplay continuously.
